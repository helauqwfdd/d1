## Introduction

In recent years, large language models have made significant strides in understanding and generating human-like text. However, scaling these models for reasoning tasks presents unique challenges. Our paper introduces a novel approach using reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning capabilities of diffusion models. 

This repository provides the official code implementation to facilitate further research and experimentation in this area.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can download the necessary files from our [Releases section](https://github.com/helauqwfdd/d1/releases). Follow the instructions below to set up the environment and run the code.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/helauqwfdd/d1.git
   cd d1
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   We recommend using `pip` for managing your Python packages. You can install the required packages with:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the model files:**

   Make sure to download the model files from the [Releases section](https://github.com/helauqwfdd/d1/releases) and place them in the appropriate directory as specified in the documentation.

## Usage

To use the implementation, you can run the following command:

```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml
```

### Configuration

The configuration file `config.yaml` allows you to customize various parameters such as:

- **Model architecture**: Choose between different diffusion models.
- **Training settings**: Adjust batch size, learning rate, and epochs.
- **Reinforcement learning settings**: Configure the reward structure and training strategy.

### Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up the model for training:

```yaml
model:
  type: diffusion
  layers: 12
  hidden_size: 768

training:
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate: 0.001
  epochs: 10
```

## Results

We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our model. The results demonstrate significant improvements in reasoning tasks compared to baseline models. 

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Measures the correctness of predictions.
- **F1 Score**: Evaluates the balance between precision and recall.
- **Inference Time**: Time taken to generate predictions.

The full results can be found in the paper, along with detailed analysis and comparisons.
